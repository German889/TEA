In order to make use of ASIO4ALL, you need to configure your audio software accordingly. How you would
do this depends on your particular software application. Generally, you would always enter the audio
configuration menu and select ASIO -> ASIO4ALL v2.
There now should be a button to launch the ASIO control panel. How this button is labeled depends on your
particular software. Once you press this button, the ASIO4ALL control panel should appear. Please consult
the manual of your audio software for further assistance, if necessary!
Sometimes, the audio software indeed would not provide an ASIO control panel option. This is the case for
e.g. some ASIO output plugins in media player software. For configuring ASIO4ALL with these
applications anyway, you can launch the control panel by clicking on the ASIO4ALL status icon in the
System Tray area.6\‘51À„
